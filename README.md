# Hello ðŸ‘‹
In this section I'll show you how can I make a project like this one.
# Steps ðŸ‘£
1) Set up the principal structure of the HTML by separating all the elements that contain the whole project. What I did was first creating a main DIV, that is the whole card, then I created another div inside the main DIV to separate the whole information on the card from the autor (including the image)
2) What I did next is set the style of the DIV's on the CSS file, making sure that the whole card is centered vertically and horizontally, as it was on the example.
3) Then I started to make the styles of all the informacion inside the card, like font-size, color, margins...

And that's really all, I don't want to be it very technical because if you see inside the code inside the HTML and CSS you'll find that is a very easy yet very good looking project.
